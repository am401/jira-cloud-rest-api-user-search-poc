### Jira Cloud REST API - User Search concept

Use the User Search REST API - https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-users/#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get to retrieve Atlassian Account users from the site, listing their account id and name. 

The primary goal is to setup a simple PoC script using a config file (JSON) to have as a template for other script ideas.
